    // Goals of this Class (Note to self Put this in a seperate README.md)
    /*
    *   Take arguments such as +-
    *
    *   move x steps    (horozontal shift)
    *   move y steps    (vertical shift)
    *   rotate Î¸ deg   (yaw)
    *
    *   and return an array of 4 step values for the motor encoders (even if encoders not used the info is valid as a time ratio)
    *   based upon the holonomic drive principal
    *
    *   the wheel step values are returned as an array with the indicies corresponding
    *   to the diagram below:
    *
    *
    *                   +y
    *     Top/Foreward Orientation/ Front of robot
    *
    *           (1) //     \\ (0)
    *    -x  Left       ^       Right  +x
    *           (3) \\     // (2)
    *
    *                 Bottom
    *                   -y
    *
    *   example:    HolomorphicDrive.rotate(180) rotates 180 Left (as per standard vector direction for rotation matrix)
    *               which returns an array of 4 items corresponding to the number of steps for each motor
